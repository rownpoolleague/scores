<a id="forfeits"></a>
2. TEAM FORFEITS AND REMATCHES:

b. Forfeiture of 1 point per individual match not played will be enforced. All matches will be played as scheduled unless a reschedule is agreed upon in advance with the approval of both team Captains and a 2-day notice given to the League Operator.
c. A team must have a player present for each forfeit point it is to receive, and those players should be listed on the score sheet as if the match were played. It is the responsibility of the forfeiting team Captain to ensure undeserved forfeit points are not awarded.
d. Any team deliberately forfeiting points in the last 2 weeks of a session may FORFEIT ALL PRIZE MONEY.
e. Any team that has a player or companion of the team or patron of their bar distracts an active shooter by touching, provocative speech or visual appeal, can have the opposing team call for forfeiture of the current match.

f. In the case of a "BYE" situation, whether it begins from week 1 or from a later week should a team drop out, the scheduled team shall be awarded 3 match points. If a team is added after the start, earlier scheduled matches will remain forfeit, however, the new team shall be awarded 2 points for each un-played match.
g. Any two competing captains may choose to break any rule in this document if they have common agreement in the proposed rule change.

<a id="disputes"></a>
3. DISPUTES AND PROTESTS
   a. In the event a dispute arises, and the players cannot resolve the problem, ONLY THE TEAM CAPTAINS may intervene on behalf of their players. If the Captains cannot resolve the dispute and the situation is not covered within this document and a League Operator cannot be contacted for a ruling, then proceed with this protest procedure:
   1. Continue playing the disputed game with the ruling in favor of the player that was shooting at the time of the dispute.
   2. Continue playing all remaining games of the match.
   3. At the end of the match, continue playing as though the disputed game was ignored, until the match is ended a second time.
   4. If the outcome of the match would be unchanged, no protest need be filed unless the grievance warrants attention.
   5. If the outcome of the match would be changed, a protest may be filed.
    When a protest is filed no match point will be awarded until a decision by the League Operator has been made. THE LEAGUE OPERATOR'S DECISION IS FINAL.
   6. The team Captains should clearly indicate the game in question on both score sheets and each write the details of the dispute on a separate sheet of paper and submit it in their envelope.
b. If the possibility of a coming questionable hit arises, it is the responsibility of the opposing player to stop play before the shot is made and enlist a Coach or Captain agreeable to both players to judge the hit. This person’s judgement will be final.


4. COIN OPERATED TABLES: Players will split the cost of all coin operated tables.

5. PLAYER SELECTION: The home team Captain will flip a coin to determine which Captain must select the first player. The winner of the coin toss has the option of selecting first or second. After the first match selection is made, the captains will alternate selecting first in the following matches.

6. COACHING: Any player, regardless of handicap, will be allowed one coach during each game of a match under the following conditions:
a. The coach must be designated at the beginning of the match. The coach must be a member of the players’ team. Barring emergency, the same coach must be used for a player’s entire match. The same coach need not be used for all matches.
b. Only the player or his coach are allowed to call out for a coach. If a coach or    time out is called but refused by the player this will not count as a coach. If a coach or time out is called a second time the player must accept the coach. Only the coach can approach the table and once the coach leaves the table, he/she CANNOT return.
c. The coach must leave the table before the shooter continues to play.
d. Coaching sessions should be no longer than 2 minutes. After 2 minutes the opposing Captain, coach or player may issue a warning. If the coaching session then goes beyond a total of 3 minutes a foul may be called giving the opposing player ball in hand.
e. When a player is being coached, the opponent may also be coached without a coach being charged.
f. Coaches may not touch any ball.
g. Any player with a question regarding the legality of any play or procedure may ask for consultation from the two team Captains without a coach being charged.

7. TEAM ROSTERS:
a. A team roster can have a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 8 players.
b. New players may be added to the roster only during the first 6 weeks of play in a session, unless approved by the League Secretary. All players must play within this time to remain on the roster and new players must play before being added to the roster. Reference the Master Roster List to determine if a "new" player is handicapped and has an existing player number.
c. If a team falls below a minimum of 6 players it is allowed to bring the team up to this number at any time during a session, however, their roster must show fewer than 6 players prior to adding any new players. Regardless, if both captains agree, players may be added at any time.
d. In the event a team does not have enough players to shoot on any given night, someone may shoot twice. This may be done more than once in a match (2 people shoot twice). However, all repeat players must be called in the last match(es) of the evening. Any player may only shoot twice ONCE every session. NO player may shoot twice on position round.
e. Players cannot change teams within the same division once the 6th week of a session has been played.

8. POSITION ROUNDS: For scheduled "position" rounds the 1st place team plays the 2nd place team, the 3rd place team plays the 4th place team and so on through the division standings. The team in higher standing will be the home team. If two teams from a participating sponsor would both be designated as home teams, the team with the higher standing would be designated home and the other would have to travel. If two or more teams are tied at any given position in the standings, head-to-head play is the first tie breaker. The lowest team number would be the second tie breaker.

9. Paperwork: Envelopes/scoring papers may be picked up at any time in advance of play after they have been made available by the League Operator.


General Game Rules
<a id="general"></a>
1. GAME DESCRIPTION: The pool game we will use in the competition is 8-ball. It is not necessary to call your pocket when shooting any object ball other than the 8-ball. When shooting the 8-ball the player must call the pocket and ensure the opponent is aware of the location marker or call the pocket. The 8-ball may not be pocketed while simultaneously pocketing your last ball. The 8-ball must be pocketed separately.

2. LAGGING, RACKING AND BREAKING: Players will lag to determine who breaks first. In lagging, each player will shoot an object ball (not a cue ball) simultaneously from behind the head string, banking the ball off the foot rail with the intention of returning the ball as close to the head rail as possible. The ball may not touch a side rail or go in a pocket as this would lose the lag. If the balls make contact the lag must be done again. The player coming closest to the head rail has the choice of breaking first. Lagging marks the beginning of a played match. The player not breaking must rack the object balls in such a way that all balls are frozen. The player breaking can ask for and receive a re-rack.
When breaking, the point at which the base of the cue ball contacts the table must be behind the head string. If the cue ball is not "in" the area behind the head string, the opposing player may ask that the cue ball be placed "in" before the break is made. No penalty would be assessed if the cue ball was shot from an "out" position. Players should break the balls as hard as possible. A legal break occurs when one of the front three balls in the rack is hit and at least 4 balls from the rack touch a rail or a ball is pocketed, and no foul has occurred. If no foul occurred and no balls were pocketed and a legal break was not made, the balls are re-racked, and the same player will attempt another break.

3. CONTINUATION OF PLAY:
a. Any foul committed during the break results in the opposing player receiving "ball in hand" behind the head string with the table open. Any ball in front of the head string as determined by where the ball contacts the table, may then be pocketed.
b. If the breaker pockets one or more balls of a single suit with no fouls, the breaker may continue to shoot, attempting to pocket balls of the same suit as that first pocketed.
c. If the breaker pockets two or more balls of multiple suits with no fouls, the breaker may continue to shoot with an open table.
d. If the breaker fails to make a ball on the break or on any following shot when the table was open, the breaker gives up play to his/her opponent with the table remaining open.
e. If the 8-ball is pocketed on the break and no fouls are committed, the breaker wins the game. If a foul was committed the breaker loses the game.
f. A player will continue play if a legal shot has been made and a ball of the correct suit has been pocketed.
g. When shooting an open table, a player may shoot at any ball of any suit, or any combination thereof until a ball is pocketed, however, the 8-ball may never be struck first. The 8-ball is not neutral.

4. COMBINATION AND KISS SHOTS: Any combination shot or kiss shot will be allowed so long as the player hits a ball of his/her suit first. The 8-ball can be a "middle" ball of a multiple ball combination.

5. JUMP SHOTS AND MASSE SHOTS: An elevation more than 45 degrees on an unobstructed shot (no wall or pole etc. to force raising of cue) will be considered a foul. This is a sponsor request not to harm the tables. If a player purposefully jumps the cue ball by "scooping" it (hitting below the equator of the ball) this will also be considered a foul.

6. POCKETING BALLS: To "pocket" a ball, the ball must remain in the pocket. If a ball "hangs" in the pocket, then moments later falls in without being touched or caused to move in any way, it is considered pocketed, providing the opponent has not yet shot. If it falls in after the opponent has shot and was not touched or caused to move, play will continue as normal, unless the ball is the 8-ball, in which case the 8-ball would be retrieved and re-spotted. If a ball in this situation falls in due to intentional bumping of the table or stomping on the floor it will be considered a foul, unless it is the 8-ball, where it would be a loss.

7. BALLS LEAVING THE TABLE: If a ball leaves the table but returns to the playing area it is not a foul. If a ball leaves the table, it will be spotted on the foot spot. If there are balls obstructing the spot, the ball is to be placed immediately vertically from the foot spot. The player may continue to shoot, provided a different ball was legally pocketed and the ball off the table was not the cue. If an 8-ball leaves the playing area it is a loss of game.

8. FOULS AND BALL-IN-HAND: Ball in hand allows a player to place the cue-ball in any position on the table. The ball may be repositioned as many times as needed until a satisfactory position is found. ONLY THE PLAYER, CAPTAIN OR COACH MAY CALL A FOUL. Do not remove the cue ball from the table until players agree on the ball-in-hand. If the players cannot agree, the matter will be decided by CAPTAINS ONLY. Fouls resulting in ball-in-hand other than those defined above are:
a. Anytime the cue ball goes into a pocket or to the floor.
b. Failure to make a "legal" shot. A legal shot is where the cue ball contacts an object ball of the correct suit FIRST and AFTER CONTACT IS MADE the cue ball or any other ball hits a rail. A pocketed ball is considered a railed ball.
c. If the object ball is frozen to the rail, the opposing player must call it a frozen ball before the shot is made. After doing so the player shooting must then after making legal contact with the object ball either pocket the object ball or drive the object ball to a rail other than the frozen rail. The cue ball may make legal contact with the "frozen ball" rail if it contacts the frozen ball clearly first. Failure results in a foul.
d. When placing a ball in hand cue, if the cue touches any object ball, no matter how slight, it is a foul. Also, when placing a long-range cue ball players are allowed to adjust the placement of the cue ball by using the shaft of their stick.
e. If any ball other than the cue is moved before a shot, the opposing player has the option of replacing it before the other player shoots.
f. During or after the shot, if the path of any moving ball is altered by anything other than that resulting from the motion of the cue ball it will be a foul. If a ball is unintentionally moved and a ball placed in motion by the cue ball strikes that ball it will be a foul. Replacement of balls unintentionally moved during or after a shot will remain the option of the opposing player.
g. Being coached by someone other than the designated coach is a foul. Anyone may tell a player to call the 8-ball pocket.
h. No more than 1 minute should be taken between shots. If a player continually abuses this guideline after being warned a foul may be called. If the 1 minute was taken then a coach requested, the player must shoot immediately after the coach has concluded.
i. Any player must have reasonable "space" in which to shoot. All players must remain a reasonable distance away while a match is in progress. All players "friends" must also comply with this rule. If "space" is not allowed, the offended player's captain will warn the opposing captain and if the situation continues the match may be forfeit.
j. A player may not stop cue ball in motion on any shot. If a player stops the cue ball after shooting the 8-ball it is a loss of game foul.
k. One foot must remain on the floor while taking your shot.

9. STALEMATE: In the unlikely event that neither player is willing to use a ball-in-hand, the game is stalemated, and the game will be re-racked and re-played with the same breaker. This game will be ignored for the counting of innings.

            The Handicap System

<a id="handicap"></a>
1. HOW IT WORKS: Each player in the League is given a "handicap" according to his/her ability. The purpose of the handicap is to equalize a player’s chances of winning in competitive match play. Your handicap indicates the number of games you must win to win a match point (i.e. if your handicap is 4 and your opponent’s handicap is 3 then you must win 4 games before your opponent wins 3 games to win the match.

2. HOW HANDICAP IS DETERMINED:
a. The handicap is calculated by taking the average of a player’s best 5 of their last 10 matches played, then comparing the resulting figure to the following table to determine the handicap number.

CALCULATED NUMBER:
Less than 2 = 7
Less than 3 = 6
Less than 4 = 5
Less than 6 = 4
Less than 8 = 3
Equal to or Higher than 8 = 2

b. An inning is marked each time the player shooting second in the first game of a match completes their turn by a miss or foul.
c. The League Operator will adjust total match innings by safety, non-performance shots or games won by default (i. e. 8- ball scratch). Safety and non-performance shots (shots deemed to be intentionally missed) will be marked on the score sheet at the discretion of the scorer. The scoring of these shots will help prevent sandbagging (intentional inflating of innings to cause lower handicaps).
d. Only the results of a player’s best 5 matches out of the players’ last 10 matches will be selected for use in handicap calculations.
e. No individual game will count more than 10 innings.
f. New players with no established handicap will begin play with a "best 3 out of 5" match versus their opponent regardless of the opponent’s current handicap.
g. If a player has an established handicap from prior play from any session, the player will not be considered a "new" player and must use the previously established handicap.
h. The League Operator reserves the right to adjust handicaps when given just cause.
i. Using the last 10 matches played, handicaps will not be raised if a player has a losing record and handicaps will not be lowered if a player has a winning record.
j. If a new player has an established handicap in another league, that handicap will transfer directly over to R-Own League.
k. A players Handicap may not go down more than 1 spot from their max Handicap achieved. That Handicap must have been held for 10 weeks.

3. INTEGRITY OF THE HANDICAP SYSTEM: The score keepers are encouraged to properly indicate all innings, safety, non-performance shots, scratches on the 8-ball and any other occurrence that may have a bearing on handicap calculation on their respective score sheets. Since we have no playoff system in this League and all cash prizes are based solely on the team standing, sandbagging at the expense of losing a match point is of little use to your team. GO FOR IT and try to get as high as you can on the League Ranking list.

4. MAXIMUM TEAM HANDICAP:
a. The maximum team handicap for the five match players in any open division match is 23.
b. Any team violating the maximum team handicap rule will FORFEIT ALL FIVE TEAM POINTS. The violation does not "officially" occur until the lag is executed in the match which causes the team handicap number to exceed the applicable limit. The captain of the opposing team may enforce this rule any time after the limit is exceeded and prior to the signing of the score sheets.
c. A new player will count as a 3 and the opponent of a new player will count as their assigned handicap when considering the above rule.

<a id="scoring"></a>
5. SCORING
- Team names and numbers filled in.
- Player names and numbers filled in with the lag winner listed first and the lag loser listed second.
- Innings in each game counted and total noted in the individual game box.
- Game winner box blacked out.
- Coaches marked by a "c" (Optional but helpful in determining foul).
- 8-ball scratches or fouls indicated by circling "S8" or "E8" in the game box.
- 8-ball on break Indicated by circling "80B" in game box.
- Total games won entered for each player.
- Total number of innings played for the match entered into the "innings" box.
- Safe/non-performance shots indicated.
- Match won box blacked out for the winner.
- Total matches won by each team.
- Signatures.
- Any notes to League Operator in top, bottom or left margins.
-The traveling or "away" team is responsible for picking up and returning the score sheets at the designated sponsors establishment by 7:00pm the following day. If you choose not to drop off paperwork a CLEAR picture may be sent to the League Operator immediately after play.

Note: Cell phones/Ear pods must not be used while it is your shot.

Any activity including but not limited to smoking, use of phone, bathroom breaks etc.. that would cause the shooter to go over the 1 minute a shot time limit must be agreed upon prior to that activity or a foul will occur.

Please be reasonable, we want to have "continuous" play.
